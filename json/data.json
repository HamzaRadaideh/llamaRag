Did you know that Amman, the capital city, is one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in the world? What do you think are some of the most interesting or unique aspects of Jordanian culture?\n\nAlso, I noticed that Jordan has been a major refuge for many refugees from neighboring countries, including Palestine and Syria. That's truly admirable! Have you had any personal experiences with refugees or asylum seekers, or do you have any thoughts on this important issue?"
