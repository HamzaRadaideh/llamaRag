Amman is Jordan's capital and largest city, as well as the most popul ous city in the Levant. Modern-day Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period.Three kingdoms emerged in Transjordan at the end of the Bronze Age: Ammon, Moab and Edom.In the third century BC, the Arab Nabataeans established their kingdom centered in Petra.Later rulers of the Transjordan region include the Assyrian, Babylonian, Roman, Byzantine, Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, and the Ottoman empires.After the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916 during World War I, the Greater Syria region was partitioned by Britain and France.The Emirate of Transjordan was established in 1921 by the Hashemite, then Emir, Abdullah I, and the emirate became a British protectorate.In 1946, Jordan gained independence and became officially know n as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.[c] The country captured and annexed the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War until it was occupied by Israel in 1967 .
Jordan renounc ed its claim to the territory to the Palestinians in 1988, and signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. Jordan is a semi-arid country, covering an area of 89,342 km2 (34,495 sq mi), with a popul ation of 11.5 million, making it the eleventh-most popul ous Arab country.The dominant majority, or around 95% of the country's popul ation, is Sunni Muslim, with the rest being mostly Arab Christian.

From as early as 1948, Jordan has accepted refugees from multiple neighbour ing countries in conflict. An estimated 2.1 million Palestinian refugees, most of whom hold Jordanian citizenship, as well as 1.4 million Syrian refugees, were residing in Jordan as of 2015.[4] The kingdom is also a refuge for thous ands of Christian Iraqis fleeing persecution.[8][9] While Jordan continues to accept refugees, the large Syrian influx during the 2010s has placed substantial strain on national resources and infrastructure.[10] The sovereign state is a constitutional monarchy, but the king holds wide executive and legislative powers.Jordan is a foundi ng member of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation.The country has a high Human Development Index, ranking 99th, and is considered a lower middle income econom y.
The Jordanian econom y, one of the smallest econom ies in the region, is attractive to foreign investors based upon a skilled workforce.[11] The country is a major tourist destination, also attracting medical tourism due to its well developed health sector.[12] Nonetheless, a lack of natural resources, large flow of refugees, and regional turmoil have hampered econom ic growth.[13] Jordan takes its name from the Jordan River, which forms much of the country's northwestern border.[14] While several theories for the origin of the river's name have been propos ed, it is most plausible that it derives from the Hebrew word Yarad (Hebrew: ירד ), meaning "the descender", reflecting the river's declivity.[15] Much of the area that makes up modern Jordan was historically called Transjordan, meaning "across the Jordan"; the term is used to denote the lands east of the river.[15] The Hebrew Bible (the foundi ng holy text of Judaism, also referred to by Christians as the Old Testament) uses the term Hebrew: הירדן עבר ,romanized: Ever ha'Yarden, lit.
'The other side of the Jordan' for the area.[15] Early Arab chronicles call the river Al-Urdunn (a term cogna te to the Hebrew Yarden).[16] Jund Al-Urdunn was a military district around the river in the earlyEtymology Website jordan.gov.jo (https://portal.jordan.gov.jo/wps/po rtal/Home?lang=en/) The 'Ain Ghazal Statues (c.
7250 BC) uncovered in Amman are some of the oldest human statues ever found.Islamic era.[16] Later, during the Crusades in the beginning of the second millennium, a lordship was established in the area unde r the name of Oultrejordain.[17] The oldest know n evidence of hominid habitation in Jordan dates back at least 200,000 years.[18] Jordan is a rich source of Paleolithic human remains (up to 20,000 years old) due to its location within the Levant, where various migrations of hominids out of Africa conve rged,[19] and its more humid climate during the Late Pleistocene, which resulted in the formation of numerous remains- preserving wetlands in the region.[20] Past lakeshore environments attracted different groups of hominids, and several remains of tools dating from the Late Pleistocene have been found there.[19] Scientists have found the world's oldest know n evidence of bread- making at a 14,500- year-old Natufian site in Jordan's northeastern desert.[21] During the Neolithic period (10,000–4,50 0 BC), there was a transition there from a hunter-gatherer culture to a culture with established popul ous agricultural villages.[22] 'Ain Ghazal, one such village located at a site in the eastern part of present-day Amman, is one of the largest know n prehistoric settlements in the Near East.[23] Dozens of plaster statues of the human form, dating to 7250 BC or earlier, have been uncovered there; they are one of the oldest large-scale representations of humans ever found.[24] During the Chalcolithic period (4500–3600 BC), several villages emerged in Transjordan including Tulaylet Ghassul in the Jordan Valley;[25] a series of circular stone enclosures in the eastern basalt desert from the same period have long ba ffled archaeologists.[26] Fortified towns and urban centres first emerged in the southern Levant early in the Bronze Age (3600–1200 BC).[27] Wadi Feynan became a regional centre for coppe r extraction - the metal was exploited on a large scale to produc e bronze.[28] Trade and movement of people in the Middle East peaked, spreading cultural innova tions and whole civilizations to spread.[29] Villages in Transjordan expanded rapidly in areas with reliable water-resources and arable land.[29] Ancient Egyptian populations expanded towards the Levant and came to control both banks of the Jordan River.[30] During the Iron A ge (1200–332 BC), after the withdrawal of the Egyptians, Transjordan was home to the Kingdom s of Ammon, Edom and Moab.[31] The peoples of these kingdom s spoke Semitic langua ges of the Canaanite group; archaeologists have concluded that their polities were tribal kingdom s rather than states.[31] Ammon was located in the Amman plateau; Moab in the highlands east of the Dead Sea; and Edom in the area around Wadi Araba in the south.[31] The northwestern region of the Transjordan, know n then as Gilead, was settled by the Israelites.[32] The Transjordanian kingdom s of Ammon, Edom and Moab continually clashed with the neighbour ing Hebrew kingdom s of Israel and Judah, centered west of the Jordan River.[33] One record of this is the Mesha Stele, erected by the Moabite king Mesha in 840 BC; in an inscription on it, he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in Moab and commemoratesHistory Ancient period The Mesha Stele (c.
840 BC) records the glory of Mesha, King of Moab, displayed at the Louvre Museum. Petra, one of the New 7 Wonders of the World, contains Al-Khazneh, believed to be the mausoleum of the Nabataean King Aretas IV, 1st century ADhis glory and his victory against the Israelites.[34] The stele constitutes one of the most important archeological parallels to accounts recorded in the Bible.[35] At the same time, Israel and the Kingdom of Aram- Damascus competed for control of the Gilead.[36][37] Around the period between 740 and 720 BC, Israel and Aram Damascus were conque red by the Neo-Assyrian Empire.
The kingdom s of Ammon, Edom & Moab were subjugated, but were allowed to maintain some degree of independence.[38] Then, in 627 BC, following after the disintegration of the Assyrians' empire, Babylonians took control of the area.[38] Although the kingdom s suppor ted the Babylonians against Judah in the 597 BC sack of Jerusalem, they rebelled against Babylon a decade later.[38] The kingdom s were reduced to vassals, a status they retained unde r the Persian and Hellenic Empires.[38] By the beginning of Roman rule around 63 BC, the kingdom s of Ammon, Edom and Moab had lost their distinct identities and were assimilated into the Roman culture.[31] Some Edomites survived longe r – driven by the Nabataeans, they had migrated to southern Judea, which became know n as Idumaea; they were later conve rted to Judaism by the Hasmoneans.[39] Alexander the Great's conque st of the Persian Empire in 332 BC introduc ed Hellenistic culture to the Middle East.[40] After Alexander's death in 323 BC, the empire split among his generals, and in the end much of Transjordan was disputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria.[40] The Nabataeans, nomadic Arabs based south of Edom, managed to establish an independent kingdom in 169 BC by exploiting the struggle between the two Greek powers.[40] The Nabataean Kingdom controlled much of the trade routes of the region, and it stretched south along the Red Sea coast into the Hejaz desert, up to as far north as Damascus, which it controlled for a short period (85–71) BC.[41] The Nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade routes, often drawing the envy of their neighbour s.[42] Petra, Nabataea's barren capital, flourished in the 1st century AD, driven by its extensive water irrigation systems and agriculture.[43] The Nabataeans were also talented stone carvers, building their most elaborate structure, Al-Khazneh, in the first century AD.[44] It is believed to be the mausoleum of the Arab Nabataean King Aretas IV.[44] Roman legions unde r Pompey conque red much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted four centuries.[45] In 106 AD, Emperor Trajan annexed Nabataea unoppos ed, and rebuilt the King's Highway which became know n as the Via Traiana Nova road.[45] The Romans gave the Greek cities of Transjordan—P hiladelphia (Amman), Gerasa (Jerash), Gedara (Umm Quays), Pella (Tabaqat Fahl) and Arbila (Irbid)—and otherClassical period The Oval Forum of Jerash (c.

Transjordan prospered during the Byzantine era, and Christian churches were built everywhere.[49] The Aqaba Church in Ayla was built during this era, it is considered to be the world's first purpose built Christian church.[50] Umm ar-Rasas in southern Amman contains at least 16 Byzantine churches.[51] Meanwhile, Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after a 363 earthqua ke destroyed many structures, it declined further, eventually being abandone d.[44] The Sassanian Empire in the east became the Byzantines' rivals, and frequent confrontations sometimes led to the Sassanids controlling some parts of the region, including Transjordan.[52] In 629 AD, during the Battle of Mu'tah in what is today Karak Governorate, the Byzantines and their Arab Christian clients, the Ghassanids, staved off an attack by a Muslim Rashidun force that marched northwards towards the Levant from the Hejaz (in modern-day Saudi Arabia).[53] The Byzantines however were defeated by the Muslims in 636 AD at the decisive Battle of the Yarmuk just north of Transjordan.[53] Transjordan was an essential territory for the conque st of Damascus.[54] The first, or Rashidun, caliphate was followed by t hat of the Umayyads (661–750) .[54] Under the Umayyad Caliphate, several desert castles were constructed in Transjordan, including: Qasr Al-Mshatta and Qasr Al-Hallabat.[54] The Abbasid Caliphate's campaign to take over the Umayyad's began in a village in Transjordan know n as Humayma.[55] A powerful 749 AD earthqua ke is thought to have contributed to the Umayyads defeat to the Abbasids, who moved the caliphate's capital from Damascus to Baghda d.[55] During Abbasid rule (750–969) , several Arab tribes moved northwards and settled in the Levant.[54] As had happened during the Roman era, growth of maritime trade diminished Transjordan's central position, and the area became increasingly impove rished.[56] After the decline of the Abbasids, Transjordan was ruled by the Fatimid Caliphate (969–1070) , then by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (1115–1 187).[57]Islamic era The Karak Castle (c.
12th century AD) built by the Crusaders, and later expanded under the Muslim Ayyubids and Mamluks. The Ajloun Castle (c.12th century AD) built by the Ayyubid leader Saladin for use against the Crusades.
Ottoman ten-arches bridge built near Amman in 1908, as part of the Hejaz railway, which stretched across the length of Transjordan and linked Damascus with Medina.The Crusaders constructed several Crusader castles as part of the Lordship of Oultrejordain, including those of Montreal and Al-Karak.[58] The Ayyubids built the Ajloun Castle and rebuilt older castles, to be used as military outposts against the Crusaders.[59] During the Battle of Hattin (1187) near Lake Tiberias just north of Transjordan, the Crusaders lost to Saladin, the founde r of the Ayyubi d dyna sty (1187–1260) .[59] Villages in Transjordan unde r the Ayyubi ds became important stops for Muslim pilgrims going to Mecca who travelled along t he route that conne cted Syria to the Hejaz.[60] Several of the Ayyubi d castles were used and expanded by the Mamluks (1260–1516) , who divided Transjordan between the provinces of Karak and Damascus.[61] During the next century Transjordan experienced Mongol attacks, but the Mongols were ultimately repelled by t he Mamluks after the Battle of Ain Jalut (1260) .[62] In 1516, the Ottoman Caliphate's forces conque red Mamluk territory.[63] Agricultural villages in Transjordan witnessed a period of relative prosperity in the 16th century, but were later abandone d.[64] Transjordan was of marginal importance to the Ottoman authorities.[65] As a result, Ottoman presence was virtually absent and reduced to annua l tax collection visits.[64] More Arab Bedouin tribes moved into Transjordan from Syria and the Hejaz during the first three centuries of Ottoman rule, including the Adwan, the Bani Sakhr and the Howeitat.[66] These tribes laid claims to different parts of the region, and with the absence of a meaningful Ottoman authority, Transjordan slid into a state of anarchy that continued until the 19th century.[67] This led to a short-lived occupation by the Wahhabi forces (1803–1812) , an ultra-orthodox Islamic movement that emerged in Najd (in modern-day Saudi Arabia).[68] Ibrahim Pasha, son of the gove rnor of the Egypt Eyalet, rooted out the Wahhabis under the request of the Ottoman sultan by 1818.[69] In 1833 Ibrahim Pasha turned on the Ottomans and established his rule over the Levant.[70] His policies led to the unsuccessful peasants' revolt in Palestine in 1834.[70] Transjordanian cities of As-Salt and Al-Karak were destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha's forces for harboring a peasants' revolt leader.[70] Egyptian rule was forcibly ended in 1841, with Ottoman rule restored.[70] Only after Ibrahim Pasha's campaign did the Ottoman Empire try to solidify its presence in the Syria Vilayet, which Transjordan was part of.[71] A series of tax and land reforms (Tanzimat) in 1864 brought some prosperity back to agriculture and to abandone d villages; the end of virtual autonom y led a backlash in other areas of Transjordan.[71] Muslim Circassians and Chechens, fleeing Russian persecution, sought refuge in the Levant.[72] In Transjordan and with Ottoman suppor t, Circassians first settled in the long- abandone d vicinity of Amman in 1867, and later in the surroundi ng villages.[72] The Ottoman authorities' establishment of its administration, conscription and heavy taxation policies led to revolts in the areas it controlled.[73] Transjordan's tribes in particular revolted during the Shouba k (1905) and the Karak Revolts (1910) , Soldiers of the Hashemite-led Arab Army holding the flag of the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire in the Hejaz, 1916.
As-Salt residents gather on 20 August 1920 during the British High Commissioner's visit to Transjordan.which were brutally suppressed.[72] The construction of the Hejaz Railway in 1908–s tretching across the length of Transjordan and linking Damascus with Medina helped the popul ation econom ically, as Transjordan became a stopove r for pilgrims.[72] Increasing policies of Turkification and centralization adopted by the Ottoman Empire in the wake of the 1908 Young Turk Revolution disenchanted the Arabs of the Levant, which contributed to the development of an Arab nationalist movement. These changes led to the outbreak of the 1916 Arab Revolt during World War I, which would end four centuries of stagnation unde r Ottoman rule.[72] The revolt was led by Sharif Hussein of Mecca, scion of the Hashemite family of the Hejaz, and his sons Abdullah, Faisal and Ali.
Locally, the revolt garnered the support of the Transjordanian tribes, including Bedouins, Circassians and Christians.[74] The Allies of World War I, including Britain and France, whose imperial interests conve rged with the Arabist cause, offered support.[75] The revolt started on 5 June 1916 from Medina and pushed northwards until the fighting reached Transjordan in the Battle of Aqaba on 6 July 1917.[76] The revolt reached its climax when Faisal entered Damascus in October 1918, and established an Arab-led military administration in OETA East, later declared as the Arab Kingdom of Syria, both of which Transjordan was part of.[74] During this period, the southernmost region of the country, including Ma'an and Aqaba, was also claimed by the neighbour ing Kingdom of Hejaz.
The nascent Hashemite Kingdom over Greater Syria was forced to surrender to French troops on 24 July 1920 during the Battle of Maysalun;[77] the French occupied only the northern part of the Syrian Kingdom , leaving Transjordan in a period of interregnum .
Arab aspirations failed to gain international recognition, due mainly to the secret 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement, which divided the region into French and British spheres of influence, and the 1917 Balfour Declaration, in which Britain announc ed its support for the establishment of a "national home" for Jews in Palestine.[78] This was seen by the Hashemites and the Arabs as a betrayal of their previous agreements with the British,[79] including the 1915 McMahon– Hussein Corresponde nce, in which the British stated their willingne ss to recognize the independence of a unified Arab state stretching from Aleppo to Aden unde r the rule of the Hashemites.[80] The British High Commissioner, Herbert Samuel, travelled to Transjordan on 21 August 1920 to meet with As-Salt's residents.
He there declared to a crowd of six hundr ed Transjordanian notables that the British gove rnment would aid the establishment of local gove rnments in Transjordan, which is to be kept separate from that of Palestine.
The second meeting took place in Umm Qais on 2 September, where the British gove rnment representative Major Fitzroy Somerset received a petition that demanded: an independent Arab gove rnment in Transjordan to be led by an Arab prince (emir); land sale in Transjordan to Jews be stoppe d as well as theModern era King Abdullah I on 25 May 1946 declaring independence, with Prime Minister Ibrahim Hashem in the background.prevention of Jewish immigration there; that Britain establish and fund a national army; and that free trade be maintained between Transjordan and the rest of the region.[81] Abdullah, the second son of Sharif Hussein, arrived from Hejaz by train in Ma'an in southern Transjordan on 21 November 1920 to redeem the Greater Syrian Kingdom his brother had lost.[82] Transjordan then was in disarray, widely considered to be ungove rnable with its dysfunctional local gove rnments.[83] Abdullah gained the trust of Transjordan's tribal leaders before scrambling to convince them of the benefits of an organized gove rnment.[84] Abdullah's successes drew the envy of the British, even when it was in their interest.[85] The British reluctantly accepted Abdullah as ruler of Transjordan after having given him a six-month trial.[86] In March 1921, the British decided to add Transjordan to their Mandate for Palestine, in which they would implement their "Sharifian Solution" policy without applying the provisions of the mandate dealing with Jewish settlement.
On 11 April 1921, the Emirate of Transjordan was established with Abdullah as Emir.[87] In September 1922, the Counc il of the League of Nations recognized Transjordan as a state unde r the terms of the Transjordan memorandum .[88][89] Transjordan remained a British mandate until 1946, but it had been granted a greater level of autonom y than the region west of the Jordan River.[90] Multiple difficulties emerged upon the assumption of power in the region by the Hashemite leadership.[91] In Transjordan, small local rebellions at Kura in 1921 and 1923 were suppressed by the Emir's forces with the help of the British.[91] Wahhabis from Najd regained strength and repeatedly raided the southern parts of his territory in (1922–1924) , seriously threatening the Emir's position.[91] The Emir was unable to repel those raids without the aid of the local Bedouin tribes and the British, who maintained a military base with a small RAF detachment close to Amman.[91] The Treaty of London , signed by the British Government and the Emir of Transjordan on 22 March 1946, recognised the independence of the state upon ratification by both countries' parliaments.[92] On 25 May 1946 , the day that the treaty was ratified by the Transjordan parliament, Transjordan was raised to the status of a kingdom unde r the name of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Arabic, with Abdullah as its first king; although it continued to be referred to as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan in English until 1949.[93][94] 25 May is now celebrated as the nation's Independence Day, a public holiday.[95] Jordan became a member of the United Nations on 14 D ecember 1955.[96] On 15 May 1948, as part of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Jordan intervened in Palestine together with many other Arab states.[97] Following the war, Jordan controlled the West Bank and on 24 April 1950 Jordan formally annexed these territories after the Jericho conference.[98][99] In response, some Arab countries demanded Jordan's expulsion from the Arab League.[98] On 12 June 1950, the Arab League declared that the annexation was a temporary, practical measure and that Jordan was holding the territory as a "trustee" pending a future settlement.[100] King Abdullah was assassinated at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in 1951 by a Palestinian militant, amid rumors he intended to sign a peace treaty with Israel.[101]Post-independence King Hussein on 21 March 1968 checking an abandoned Israeli tank in the aftermath of the Battle of Karameh.Abdullah was succeeded by his son Talal, who would soon abdicate due to illness in favour of his eldest son Hussein.[102] Talal established the country's modern constitution in 1952.[102] Hussein ascended to the throne in 1953 at the age of 17.[101] Jordan witnessed great political uncertainty in the following period.[103] The 1950 s were a period of political upheaval, as Nasserism and Pan-Arabism swept the Arab World.[103] On 1 March 1956, King Hussein Arabized the command of the Army by dismissing a number of senior British officers, an act made to remove remaining foreign influence in the country.[104] In 1958, Jordan and neighbour ing Hashemite Iraq formed the Arab Federation as a response to the formation of the rival United Arab Republic between Nasser's Egypt and Syria.[105] The union lasted onl y six months, being dissolved after Iraqi King Faisal II (Hussein's cousin) was deposed by a bloody military coup on 14 July 1958.[105] Jordan signed a military pact with Egypt just before Israel launched a preemptive strike on Egypt to begin the Six-Day War in June 1967, where Jordan and Syria joined the war.[106] The Arab states were defeated and Jordan lost control of the West Bank to Israel.[106] The War of Attrition with Israel followed, which included the 1968 Battle of Karameh where the combined forces of the Jordanian Armed Forces and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) repelled an Israeli attack on the Karameh camp on the Jordanian border with the West Bank.[106] Despite the fact that the Palestinians had limited involvement against the Israeli forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world.[107] As a result, the time period following the battle witnessed an upsurge of suppor t for Palestinian paramilitary elements (the fedayeen) within Jordan from other Arab countries.[107] The fedayeen activities soon became a threat to Jordan's rule of law.[107] In September 1970, the Jordanian army targeted the fedayeen and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from various PLO groups into Lebanon, in a conflict that became know n as Black September.[107] In 1973, Egypt and Syria waged the Yom Kippur War on Israel, and fighting occurred along the 1967 Jordan River cease-fire line.[107] Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to attack Israeli units on Syrian territory but did not engage Israeli forces from Jordanian territory.[107] At the Rabat summit conference in 1974, in the aftermath of the Yom-Kippur War, Jordan agreed, along with the rest of the Arab League, that the PLO was the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people".[107] Subsequently, Jordan renounc ed its claims to the West Bank in 1988.[107] At the 1991 Madrid Conference, Jordan agreed to negotiate a peace treaty spons ored by the US and the Soviet Union.[107] The Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace was signed on 26 October 1994.[107] In 1997, in retribution for a bombing, Israeli agents entered Jordan using Canadian passports and poisoned Khaled Meshal, a senior Hamas leader living in Jordan.[107] Bowing to intense international pressure, Israel provided an antidote to the poison and released dozens of political prisoners, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, after King H ussein threatened to annul the peace treaty.[107] On 7 February 1999 , Abdullah II ascended the throne upon the death of his father Hussein, who had ruled for nearly 50 years.[108] Abdullah embarked on econom ic liberalization when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an econom ic boom which continued until 2008.[109] Abdullah II has been credited with increasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the founda tion for Army Chief Habis Majali and Prime Minister Wasfi Tal during a military parade in 1970, two widely acclaimed national figures.
Wadi Rum is a valley in southern Jordan whose resemblance to the surface of Mars has made it a popular tourist and filming location, including scenes of The Martian.Aqaba's free-trade zone and Jordan's flourishing information and communication technology (ICT) sector.[109] He also set up five other special econom ic zones.[109] However, during the following years Jordan's econom y experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the Great Recession and spillover from the Arab Spring.[110] Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured.[111] The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians.[111] The attack is considered to be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal security was dramatically improved afterwards.[111] No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then.[112] Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel, its relationship with the West, and its mostly non- religious laws.[113] The Arab Spring were large-scale protests that erupted in the Arab World in 2011, demanding econom ic and political reforms.[114] Many of these protests tore down regimes in some Arab nations, leading to instability that ended with violent civil wars.[114] In Jordan, in response to domestic unrest, Abdullah replaced his prime minister and introduc ed a number of reforms including: reforming the Constitution, and laws gove rning public freedoms and elections.[114] Proportional representation was re-introduc ed to the Jordanian parliament in the 2016 general election, a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing parliamentary gove rnments.[115] Jordan was left largely unscathed from the violence that swept the region despite an influx of 1.4 million Syrian refugees into the natural resources-lacking country and the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[115] On 4 April 2021, 19 people were arrested, including Prince Hamzeh, the former crown prince of Jordan, who w as placed unde r hous e arrest, after having be en accused of working to "destabilize" the kingdom .
Jordan sits strategically at the crossroads of the continents of Asia, Africa and Europe,[116] in the Levant area of the Fertile Crescent, a cradle of civilization.[117] It is 89,341 square kilometres (34,495 sq mi) large, and 400 kilometres (250 mi) long between its northernmost and southernmost points; Umm Qais and Aqaba respectively.[14] The kingdom lies between 29° and 34° N, and 34° and 40° E. It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and the east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, and Israel and Palestine (West Bank) to the west.
The east is an arid plateau irrigated by oases and seasonal water streams.[14] Major cities are overwhelmingly located on the north- western part of the kingdom due to its fertile soils and relatively abunda nt rainfall.[118] These include Irbid, Jerash and Zarqa in theGeography The Dead Sea, which is located along Jordan's western border, is the lowest point on Earth and a natural resort that has attracted visitors from across the region for thousands of years.northwest, the capital Amman and As-Salt in the central west, and Madaba, Al-Karak and Aqaba in the southwest.[118] Major towns in the eastern part of the country are the oasis towns of Azraq and Ruwaished.[117] In the west, a highland area of arable land and Mediterranean evergreen forestry drops sudde nly into the Jordan Rift Valley.[117] The rift valley contains the Jordan River and the Dead Sea, which separates Jordan from Israel.[117] Jordan has a 26 kilometres (16 mi) shoreline on the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea, but is otherwise landlocked.[119] The Yarmuk River, an eastern tributary of the Jordan, forms part of the bounda ry between Jordan and Syria (including the occupied Golan Heights) to the north.[119] The other bounda ries are formed by several international and local agreements and do not follow well-defined natural features.[117] The highest point is Jabal Umm al Dami, at 1,854 m (6,083 ft) above sea level, while the lowest is the Dead Sea −420 m (−1,378 f t), the lowest land poi nt on E arth.[117] Jordan has a diverse range of habitats, ecosystems and biota due to its varied landscapes and environments.[120] The Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature was set up in 1966 to protect and manage Jordan's natural resources.[121] Nature reserves in Jordan include the Dana Biosphere Reserve, the Azraq Wetland Reserve, the Shaumari Wildlife Reserve and the Mujib Nature Reserve.[121] The climate in Jordan varies greatly.
Generally, the further inland from the Mediterranean, there are greater contrasts in temperature and less rainfall.[14] The country's average elevation is 812 m (2,664 ft) (SL).[14] The highlands above the Jordan Valley, mountains of the Dead Sea and Wadi Araba and as far south as Ras Al-Naqab are dominated by a Mediterranean climate, while the eastern and northeastern areas of the country are arid desert.[122] Although the desert parts of the kingdom reach high temperatures, the heat is usually moderated by low humidity and a daytime breeze, while the nights are cool.[123] Summers, lasting from May to September, are hot and dry, with temperatures averaging around 32 °C (90 °F) and sometimes exceeding 40 °C (104 °F) between July and August.[123] The winter, lasting from November to March, is relatively cool, with temperatures averaging around 11.08 °C (52 °F).[122] Winter also sees frequent showers and oc casional snowfall in some western elevated areas.[122] Over 2,000 plant species have been recorded in Jordan.[124] Many of the flowering plants bloom in the spring after the winter rains and the type of vegetation depends largely on the levels of precipitation.
The mountainous regions in the northwest are clothed in forests, while further south and east the vegetation becomes more scrubby and transitions to steppe-type vegetation.[125] Forests cover 1.5 million dunum s (1,500 km2), less than 2% of Jordan, making Jordan among the world's least forested countries, the international average being 15% .[126]Climate Biodiversity A forest in Ajloun, northern Jordan.

Jordan's constitution, adopted in 1952 and amended a number of times since, is the legal framework that gove rns the monarch, gove rnment, bicameral legislature and judiciary.[134] The king retains wide executive and legislative powers from the gove rnment and parliament.[135] The king exercises his powers through the gove rnment that he appoints for a four-year term, which is respons ible before the parliament that is made up of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The judiciary is independent according to the constitution, but in practice often lacks independence.[134] The king is the head of state and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces.He can declare war and peace, ratify laws and treaties, conve ne and close legislative sessions, call and postpone elections, dismiss the gove rnment and dissolve the parliament.[134] The appointed gove rnment can also be dismissed through a majority vote of no confidence by the elected House of Representatives.
After a bill is proposed by the gove rnment, it must be approved by the House of Representatives then the Senate, and becomes law after being ratified by the king. A royal veto on legislation can be overridden by a two-thirds vote in a joint session of both hous es.
The parliament also has the right of interpellation.[134] The 65 members of the uppe r Senate are directly appointed by the king, the constitution mandates that they be veteran politicians, judge s and generals who previously served in the gove rnment or in the House of Representatives.[136] The 130 members of the lower House of Representatives are elected through party-listGovernment and politics The House of Representatives during a parliamentary sessionproportional representation in 23 constituencies for a 4-year term.[137] Minimum quotas exist in the House of Representatives for women (15 seats, though they won 20 seats in the 2016 election), Christians (9 seats) and Circassians and Chechens (3 seats).[138] Courts are divided into three categories: civil, religious, and special.[139] The civil courts deal with civil and criminal matters, including cases brought against the gove rnment.[139] The civil courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal,[139] High Administrative Courts which hear cases relating to administrative matters,[140] and the Constitutional Court which was set up in 2012 in order to hear cases regarding the constitutionality of laws.[141] Although Islam is the state religion, the constitution preserves religious and personal freedoms.
Religious law only extends to matters of personal status such as divorce and inheritance in religious courts, and is partially based on Islamic Sharia law.[142] The special court deals with cases forwarded by t he civil one.[143] The capital city of Jordan is Amman, located in north-central Jordan.[144] Jordan is divided into 12 gove rnorates (muhafazah) (informally groupe d into three regions: northern, central, southern). These are subdivided into a total of 52 districts (Liwaa'), which are further divided into neighbour hoods in urban areas or into towns in rural ones.[145] The monarch, Abdullah II, ascended to the throne in February 1999 after the death of his father King Hussein.Abdullah re-affirmed Jordan's commitment to the peace treaty with Israel and its relations with the United States.He refocused the gove rnment's agenda on econom ic reform, during his first year.
King Abdullah's eldest son, Prince Hussein, is the Crown Prince of Jordan.[146] The prime minister is Bisher Khasawneh who received his position on 12 October 2020.[147] Abdullah had announc ed his intention to move Jordan to a parliamentary system, where the largest bloc in parliament forms a government.
However, the unde rdevelopment of political parties in a country where tribal identity remains strong has hampered the effort.[148] Jordan has approximately fifty political parties representing nationalist, leftist, Islamist, and liberal ideologies.[149] Political parties contested one -fifth of the seats in the 2016 e lections, the remainder belonging to independent politicians.[150] Freedom House ranked Jordan as "Not Free" in the Freedom in the World 2022 report.[151] Jordan ranked 94th globally in the Cato Institute's Human Freedom Index in 2021,[152] and ranked 58th in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) issued by Transparency International in 2021.[153] In the 2023 Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, Jordan ranked 146 out of 180 countries. The overall score for Jordan 42.79, based on a scale from 0 (least free) to 105 (most free).
The 2015 report noted "the Arab Spring and the Syrian conflict have led the authorities to tighten their grip on the media and, in particular, the Internet, despite an outcry from civil society".[154] Jordanian media consists of public and private institutions. Popular Jordanian newspapers include Al Ghad and the Jordan Times.Al-Mamlaka, Roya TV and Jordan TV are some Jordanian television channels.[155] Internet penetration in Jordan reached 76% in 2015.[156] There were concerns that the gove rnment would use the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan to silence dissidents.[157][158] Largest cities or towns in Jordan According to the 2015 Census[159] Rank Name Governorate Municipal pop.

During the first Gulf War (1990) , these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and its maintenance of relations with Iraq.Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq and in the Southwest Asia peace process.
After King Hussein's death in 1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly improved.[161] Jordan is a key ally of the US and UK and, together with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, is one of only three Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour .[162] Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest.[163] The ruling Hashemite dyna sty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel– Jordan peace treaty.
Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.[164] Jordan is a foundi ng member of the Organisation of Islamic Coope ration and of the Arab League.[165][166] It enjoys "advanced status" with the European Union and is part of the European Neighbou rhood Policy (ENP), which aims to increase links between the EU and its neighbour s.[167] Jordan and Morocco tried to Syria Iraq Israel Saudi ArabiaPalestineIrbid JerashAjloun Mafraq Zarqa AmmanBalqa Madaba Karak Tafilah Ma'an Aqaba Foreign relations An Amman City Centre Police patrol vehicle.
Jordan's law enforcement was ranked 37th globally by the 2016 World Internal Security and Police Index.join the Gulf Coope ration Counc il (GCC) in 2011, but the Gulf countries offered a five-year development aid programme instead.[168] The first organised army in Jordan was established on 22 October 1920, and was named the "Arab Legion".[91] The Legion grew from 150 men in 1920 to 8,000 in 1946.[169] Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War proved that the Arab Legion, know n today as the Jordan Armed Forces, was the most effective among the Arab troops involved in the war.[169] The Royal Jordanian Army, which boasts around 110,000 personne l, is considered to be among the most professional in the region, due to being particularly well-trained and organised.[169] The Jordanian military enjoys strong support and aid from the United States, the United Kingdom and France.
This is due to Jordan's critical position in the Middle East.[169] The development of Special Operations Forces has been particularly significant, enhancing the capability of the military to react rapidly to threats to homeland security, as well as training special forces from the region and beyond.[170] Jordan provides extensive training to the security forces of several Arab countries.[171] There are about 50,000 Jordanian troops working with the United Nations in peacekeeping missions across the world. Jordan ranks third internationally in participation in U.N.peacekeeping missions,[172] with one of the highest levels of peacekeeping troop contributions of all U.N.
member states.[173] Jordan has dispatched several field hospitals to conflict zones and areas affected by natural disasters across the region.[174] In 2014, Jordan joined an aerial bombardment campaign by an international coalition led by the United States against the Islamic State as part of its intervention in the Syrian Civil War.[175] In 2015, Jordan participated in the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who w as deposed in the 2011 upr ising.[176] Jordan's law enforcement is unde r the purview of the Public Security Directorate (which includes approximately 50,000 persons) and the General Directorate of Gendarmerie, both of which are subordinate to the country's Ministry of Interior.
The first police force in the Jordanian state was organised after the fall of the Ottoman Empire on 11 April 1921.[177] Until 1956 police duties were carried out by the Arab Legion and the Transjordan Frontier Force. After that year the Public Safety Directorate was established.[177] The number of female police officers is increasing.In the 1970s , it was the first Arab country to include women in its police force.[178] Jordan's law enforcement was ranked 37th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East, in terms of police services' performance, by t he 2016 W orld Internal Security and Police Index.[179][180]Military Law enforcement Economy Change in per capita GDP of Jordan, 1950–2018.Figures are inflation- adjusted to 2011 International Geary- Khamis dollars.
View of a part of the capital AmmanJordan is classified by the World Bank as a lower middle income country.[181] Approximately 15.7% of the popul ation lives below the national pove rty line as of 2018,[182] while almost a third fell below the national pove rty line during some time of the year— know n as transient pove rty.[183] The economy, which has a GDP of $39.453 billion (as of 2016 ),[5] grew at an average rate of 8% per annum between 2004 and 2008, and around 2.6% 2010 onwards.[14] GDP per capita rose by 351% in the 1970s , declined 30% in the 1980s , and rose 36% in the 1990s —currently $9,406 per capita by purchasing power parity.[184] The Jordanian econom y is one of the smallest econom ies in the region, and the country's popul ace suffers from relatively high rates of unemployment and pove rty.[14] Jordan's econom y is relatively well-diversified.
Trade and finance combined account for nearly one-third of GDP; transportation and communication, public utilities, and construction account for one-fifth, and mining and manufacturing constitute nearly another fifth.[13] Net official development assistance to Jordan in 2009 totalled US$761 million; according to the gove rnment, approximately two-thirds of this was allocated as grants, of which half was direct budge t suppor t.[185] The official currency is the Jordanian dinar, which is pegged to the IMF's special drawing rights (SDRs), equivalent to an exchange rate of 1 US$ ≡ 0.709 dinar, or approximately 1 dinar ≡ 1.41044 dollars.[186] In 2000, Jordan joined the World Trade Organization and signed the Jordan–United States Free Trade Agreement, thus becoming the first Arab country to establish a free trade agreement with the United States.
Jordan enjoys advanced status with the EU, which has facilitated greater access to export to European markets.[187] Due to slow domestic growth, high energy and food subsidies and a bloated public-sector workforce, Jordan usually runs annua l budge t deficits.[188] The Great Recession and the turmoil caused by the Arab Spring have depressed Jordan's GDP growth, damaging trade, indus try, construction and tourism.[14] Tourist arrivals have droppe d sharply since 2011.[189] Since 2011, the natural gas pipeline in Sinai supplying Jordan from Egypt was attacked 32 times by Islamic State affiliates.
Jordan incurred billions of dollars in losses because it had to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils to generate electricity.[190] In November 2012, the gove rnment cut subsidies on fuel, increasing its price.[191] The decision, which was later revoke d, caused large scale protests to break out across the country.[188][189] Jordan's total foreign debt in 2011 was $19 billion, representing 60% of its GDP.
In 2016, the debt reached $35.1 billion representing 93% of its GDP.[110] This substantial increase is attributed to effects of regional instability causing a decrease in tourist activity, decreased foreign investments, increased military expenditures, attacks on Egyptian pipelines, the collapse of trade with Iraq and Syria, expenses from hosting Syrian refugees, and accumulated interest from loans.[110] According to the World Bank, Syrian refugees have cost Jordan more than $2.5 billion a year, amounting to 6% of the GDP and 25% of the gove rnment's annua l revenue.[192] Foreign aid covers only a small part of these costs, 63% of the total costs Queen Alia International Airport near Amman was chosen as the best airport in the Middle East for 2014 and 2015 by ASQ.are covered by Jordan.[193] An austerity programme was adopted by the gove rnment which aims to reduce Jordan's debt-to-GDP ratio to 77 percent by 2021.[194] The programme succeeded in preventing the debt from rising above 95% in 2018.[195] The proportion of well-educated and skilled workers in Jordan is among the highest in the region in sectors such as ICT and industry, due to a relatively modern educational system.
This has attracted large foreign investments to Jordan and has enabled the country to export its workforce to Persian Gulf countries.[11] Flows of remittances to Jordan grew rapidly, particularly during the end of the 1970s and 1980s , and remains an important source of external funding.[196] Remittances from Jordanian expatriates were $3.8 billion in 2015, a notable rise in the amount of transfers compared to 2014 where remittances reached over $3.66 bi llion, m aking Jordan the fourth-largest recipient in the region.[197] Jordan is ranked as having the 35th best infrastructure in the world, one of the highest rankings in the developing world, according to the 2010 World Econom ic Forum's Index of Econom ic Competitiveness.
This high infrastructural development is necessitated by its role as a transit country for goods and services mainly to Palestine and Iraq.[198] According to data from the Jordanian Ministry of Public Works and Housing, as of 2011, the Jordanian road network consisted of 2,878 km (1,788 mi) of main roads; 2,592 km (1,611 mi) of rural roads and 1,733 km (1,077 mi) of side roads. The Hejaz Railway built during the Ottoman Empire which extended from Damascus to Mecca will act as a base for future railway expansion plans.Currently, the railway has little civilian activity; it is primarily used for transporting goods .A national railway project is currently unde rgoing studies and seeking funding sources.[199] The capital Amman has a network of public transportation buses including the Amman Bus and the Amman Bus Rapid Transit and is conne cted to nearby Zarqa through t he Amman-Zarqa Bus Rapid Transit.
Jordan has three commercial airports, all receiving and dispatching international flights. Two are in Amman and the third is in Aqaba, King Hussein International Airport.Amman Civil Airport serves several regional routes and charter flights while Queen Alia International Airport is the major international airport in Jordan and is the hub for Royal Jordanian Airlines, the flag carrier.Queen Alia International Airport expansion was completed in 2013 with new terminals costing $700 million, to handle over 16 million passengers annua lly.[200] It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and was awarded 'the best airport by region: Middle East' for 2014 and 2015 by Airport Service Quality (ASQ) survey, the world's leading airport passenger satisfaction be nchmark programme.[201] The Port of Aqaba is the only port in Jordan.In 2006, the port was ranked as being the "Best Container Terminal" in the Middle East by Lloyd's List.
The port was chosen due to it being a transit cargo port for other neighbour ing countries, its location between four countries and three continents, being an exclusive gateway for the local market and for the improvements it has recently witnessed.[202]Transportation Tourism Al-Maghtas ruins on the Jordanian side of the Jordan River, believed to have been the location of the Baptism of Jesus and the ministry of John the Baptist The Dana Biosphere Reserve in southern Jordan lies along the Jordan Trail, a hiking path that is gaining popularityThe tourism sector is considered a cornerstone of the econom y and is a large source of employment, hard currency, and econom ic growth. In 2010, there were 8 million visitors to Jordan.The majority of tourists coming to Jordan are from European and Arab countries.[12] The tourism sector in Jordan has been severely affected by regional turbulence.[203] The most recent blow to the tourism sector was caused by the Arab Spring.
Jordan experienced a 70% decrease in the number of tourists from 2010 to 2016.[204] Tourist num bers started to recover as of 2017.[204] According to the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Jordan is home to around 100,000 archaeological and tourist sites.[205] Some very well preserved historical cities include Petra and Jerash, the former being Jordan's most popul ar tourist attraction and an icon of the kingdom .[204] Jordan, as part of the Holy Land, has numerous biblical sites, including: Al-Maghtas—a traditional location for the Baptism of Jesus, Mount Nebo, Umm ar- Rasas, Madaba and Machaerus.[206] Islamic sites include shrines of the prophe t Muhammad's companions such as Abd Allah ibn Rawahah, Zayd ibn Harithah and Muadh ibn Jabal.[207] Ajloun Castle built by Muslim Ayyubi d leader Saladin in the 12th century AD during his wars with the Crusaders, is also a popul ar tourist attraction.[116] Modern entertainment, recreation and souqs in urban areas, mostly in Amman, also attract tourists.
Recently, the nightlife in Amman, Aqaba and Irbid has started to emerge and the number of bars, discos and nightclubs is on the rise.[208] Alcohol is widely available in tourist restaurants, liquor stores and even some supermarkets.[209] Valleys including Wadi Mujib and hiking trails in different parts of the country attract adventurers. Hiking is getting more and more popular among tourists and locals.Places such as Dana Biosphere Reserve and Petra offer numerous signpos ted hiking trails.Moreover, seaside recreation is present on the shores of Aqaba and the Dead Sea through several international resorts.[210] Jordan has been a medical tourism destination in the Middle East since the 1970s .A study conduc ted by Jordan's Private Hospitals Association found that 250,000 patients from 102 countries received treatment in Jordan in 2010, compared to 190,00 0 in 2007, bringing over $1 billion in revenue.
Jordan is the region's top medical tourism destination, as rated by the World Bank, and fifth in the world overall.[211] The majority of patients come from Yemen, Libya and Syria due to the ongoi ng civil wars in those countries. Jordanian doc tors and m edical staff have gained experience in dealing with war patients through years of receiving such cases from various conflict zones in the region.[212] Jordan also is a hub for natural treatment methods in both Ma'in Hot Springs and the Dead Sea.The Dead Sea is often described as a 'natural spa'.It contains 10 times more salt than the average ocean, which makes it impossible to sink in.
The high salt concentration of the Dead Sea has been proven therapeutic for many skin diseases.[213] The uniqueness of this lake attracts several Jordanian and foreign vacationers, which boos ted investments in the hotel sector in the area.[214] A phosphate train at Ram stationThe Jordan Trail, a 650 km (400 mi) hiking trail stretching the entire country from north to south, crossing several of Jordan's attractions was established in 2015.[215] The trail aims to revive the Jordanian tourism sector.[215] Jordan is among the most water-scarce nations on earth.
At 97 cubic metres of water per person per year, it is considered to face "absolute water scarcity" according to the Falkenmark Classification.[216] Scarce resources to begin with have been aggravated by the massive influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan, many of whom face issues of access to clean water due to living in informal settlements (see "Immigrants and Refugees" below).[217] Jordan shares both of its two main surface water resources, the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers, with neighbo uring countries, adding complexity to water allocation decisions.[216] Water from Disi aquifer and ten major dams historically played a large role in providing Jordan's need for freshwater.[218] The Jawa Dam in northeastern Jordan, which dates back to the fourth millennium BC, is the world's oldest dam.[219] The Dead Sea is receding at an alarming rate. Multiple canals and pipelines were proposed to reduce its recession, which had begun causing sinkhol es.
The Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conve yance project, carried out by Jordan, will provide water to the country and to Israel and Palestine, while the brine will be carried to the Dead Sea to help stabilise its levels. The first phase of the project is scheduled to begin in 2019 a nd to be completed in 2021.[220] Natural gas was discovered in Jordan in 1987, however, the estimated size of the reserve discovered was about 230 billion cubic feet, a minuscule quantity compared with its oil-rich neighbour s.The Risha field, in the eastern desert beside the Iraqi border, produc es nearly 35 million cubic feet of gas a day, which is sent to a nearby power plant to generate a small amount of Jordan's electricity needs.[221] This led to a reliance on importing oil to generate almost all of its electricity.Regional instability over the decades halted oil and gas supply to the kingdom from various sources, making it incur billions of dollars in losses.
Jordan built a liquified natural gas port in Aqaba in 2012 to temporarily substitute the supply, while formulating a strategy to rationalize energy consumption and to diversify its energy sources. Jordan receives 330 days of sunshine per year, and wind speeds reach over 7 m/s in the mountainous areas, so renewables proved a promising sector.[222] King Abdullah inaugurated large-scale renewable energy pr ojects in the 2010s including the 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm, the 53 MW Shams Ma'an, and the 103 MW Quweira solar power plants, with several more projects planned.
By early 2019, it was reported that more than 1090 MW of renewable energy projects had been completed, contributing to 8% of Jordan's electricity up from 3% in 2011, while 92% was generated from gas.[223] After having initially set the percentage of renewable energy Jordan aimed to generate by 2020 at 10%, the government announc ed in 2018 that it sought to beat that figure and aim for 20% .[224] Jordan has the 5th largest oil-shale reserves in the world, which could be commercially exploited in the central and northwestern regions of the country.[225] Official figures estimate the kingdom 's oil shale reserves at more than 70 billion tonne s.
The extraction of oil-shale had been delayed a couple of years due to technological difficulties and the relatively higher costs.[226] The gove rnment overcame the difficulties and in 2017 laid the groundbr eaking for the Attarat Power Plant, a $2.2 billion oil shale-dependent power plant that is expected to generate 470 MW after it is completed in 2020.[227] Jordan also aims to benefitNatural resources The Aqaba Flagpole in the southernmost city of Aqaba, Jordan's only coastal outlet The 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm in southern Jordan is the first and largest commercial wind farm in the Middle East.[235]from its large uranium reserves by tapping nuclear energy. The original plan involved constructing two 1000 MW reactors but has been scrapped due to financial constraints.[228] Currently, the country's Atomic Energy Commission is considering building small modular reactors instead, whose capacities hove r below 500 MW and can provide new water sources through desalination.
In 2018, the commission announc ed that Jordan was in talks with multiple companies to build the country's first commercial nuclear plant, a helium- cooled reactor that is scheduled for completion by 2025.[229] Phosphate mines in the south have made Jordan one of the largest produc ers and exporters of the mineral in the world.[230] Jordan's well developed indus trial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, construction, and power, accounted for approximately 26% of the GDP in 2004 (including manufacturing, 16.2% ; construction, 4.6% ; and mining, 3.1% ).

In the past, Jordan had given many Palestinian refugees citizenship, however recently Jordanian citizenship is given only in rare cases.370,000 of these Palestinians live in UNRWA refugee camps.[243] Following the capture of the West Bank by Israel in 1967, Jordan revoke d the citizenship of thousands of Palestinians to thwart any attempt to permanently resettle from the West Bank to Jordan.
West Bank Palestinians with family in Jordan or Jordanian citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all the rights of Jordanian citizenship if requested.[244] Up to 1,000,000 Iraqis moved to Jordan following the Iraq War in 2003,[245] and most of them have returned.

Its proclaimed capital is Jerusalem while Ramallah serves as its administrative center and Gaza City was its largest city until massive popul ation movements began in 2023 due to the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip.[3][4] Arabic is the official langua ge. The majority of Palestinians practice Islam while Christianity also has a significant presence.The region of Palestine has played an important part in world history.The Canaanites, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines all left their mark on the land.In addition to its historical significance, Palestine holds profound religious importance for Judaism, Christianity and Islam.Throughout history the region has experienced periods of coexistence and conflict between different religious and ethnic groups .Notably, during the Middle Ages, when Jewish communities faced persecution, they found refuge and protection unde r Muslim rule and the wider Islamic world.
The Ottoman Empire, which controlled Palestine from the 16th century until its collapse at the end of World War I, provided a sanctuary for Jews fleeing persecution in Europe. The end of Ottoman rule marked a new chapter in Palestine's history.Following World War I, the British Empire assumed control of the region unde r the League of Nations mandate.The British Mandate for Palestine, established in 1920, brought significant changes to the political and social landscape of the area, setting the stage for the conflicts and struggles that would follow.The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 was accompanied by a war which led to the forced displacement of 700,000 Palestinians and created a large refugee popul ation.[19] Subsequent Arab–Israeli wars, including the Six-Day War in 1967, resulted in the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the"Fida'i"[1] Territory claimed by Palestine (green).[2] Claimed territory annexed by Israel (light green).

On 15th November 1988, Palestinian National Counc il, the legislative body of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) led by Yasser Arafat, declared the establishment of the State.
Signing of the Oslo Accords in the 1990s , negotiated between Israel and the PLO, created the Palestinian Authority (PA) to exercise partial control over parts of Palestinian territories. In 2007, internal divisions between Palestinian political factions led to a takeover of the Gaza Strip by Hamas.Since then, the West Bank has been gove rned in part by the Palestinian Authority, led by Fatah, while the Gaza Strip has remained unde r the control of Hamas.Israel has built settlements in both of the Palestinian territories since the start of the occupation.The settlements in the Gaza Strip were dismantled in Israel's unilateral disengagement in 2005, and approximately 670,000 Israeli settlers live in settlements in the West Bank.The international community considers Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories illegal unde r international law, but the Israeli gove rnment disputes this.
Currently, the biggest challenges to the country include the Israeli occupation, a partial blockade, restrictions on movement, Israeli settlements and settler violence, as well as an overall poor security situation. The questions of Palestine's borders, the legal and diplomatic status of Jerusalem, and the right of return of Palestinian refugees remain unsolved.Despite these challenges, the country maintains an emerging econom y and sees frequent tourism.As of June 2024, Palestine is recognized as a sovereign state by 144 out of 193 member states of the United Nations.It is also a member of several international organizations, including the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Coope ration.
It has been a non-member observer state of the United Nations since 2012.[20] Although the concept of the Palestine region and its geographical extent has varied throughout history, it is now considered to be composed by the modern State of Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.[21] General use of the term "Palestine" or related terms to the area at the southeast corner of the Mediterranean Sea beside Syria has historically been taking place since the times of ancient Greece, with Herodotus being the first historian writing in the 5th century BC in The Histories of a "district of Syria, called Palaistine" in which Phoenicians interacted with other maritime peoples.[22][23] The termEtymology Gini (2016) 33.7[13] medium HDI (2021) 0.715[14] high (106th) Currency Egyptian pound (EGP) Israeli new shekel (ILS) Jordanian dinar (JOD) (de facto)[15] Time zone UTC+2 (Palestine Standard Time) • Summer (DST) UTC+3 (Palestine Summer Time) Date format dd/mm/yyyy Driving side right Calling code +970 ISO 3166 code PS Internet TLD .ps Deir Yassin massacre was done by Irgun and Lehi"Palestine" (in Latin, Palæstina) is thought to have been a term coined by the Ancient Greeks for the area of land occupied by the Philistines, although t here are other explanations.[24] This article uses the terms "Palestine", "State of Palestine", "occupied Palestinian territory (oPt or OPT)" interchangeably depending on context.
Specifically, the term "occupied Palestinian territory" refers as a whole to the geographical area of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967.
In all cases, any references to land or territory refer to land claimed by the State of Palestine.[25] During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as nationalist sentiments grew across the region, Palestinian Arab nationalism also began to emerge.[26] Intellectuals and elites in Palestine expressed a sense of identity and called for greater autonom y and self-gove rnance.[27] This period coincided with the rise of the Young Turks movement within the Ottoman Empire, which introduc ed some political reforms but also faced oppos ition from various groups .[28] In the early 20th century, the Zionist movement gained momentum, aiming to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine.[29][30] Jewish immigration increased, and Zionist organizations purchased land from local landow ners, leading to tensions between Jews and Arabs.[31] Abdul Hamid, the last sultan of the Ottoman Empire, oppos ed the Zionist movement's efforts in Palestine.
The end of the Ottoman Empire's rule in Palestine came with the conclusion of World War I.
Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the region came unde r British control with the implementation of the British Mandate for Palestine in 1920.[32][33] The defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I resulted in the dismantling of their rule.[34] In 1920, the League of Nations granted Britain the mandate to govern Palestine, leading to the subsequent period of British administration.[34] In 1917, Jerusalem was captured by British forces led by General Allenby, marking the end of Ottoman rule in the city.[34] By 1920, tensions escalated between Jewish and Arab communities, resulting in violent clashes and riots across Palestine.[34] The League of Nations approved the British Mandate for Palestine in 1922, entrusting Britain with the administration of the region.[34] Throughout the 1920s , Palestine experienced growing resistance from both Jewish and Arab nationalist movements, which manifested in sporadic violence and protests against British policies.[34] In 1929, violent riots erupted in Palestine due to disputes over JewishTerminology History British Mandate immigration and access to the Western Wall in Jerusalem.[34] The 1930s witnessed the outbreak of the Arab Revolt, as Arab nationalists demanded an end to Jewish immigration and the establishment of an independent Arab state.[34] In response to the Arab Revolt, the British deployed military forces and implemented stringent security measures in an effort to que ll the uprising.[34] Arab nationalist groups , led by the Arab Higher Committee, called for an end to Jewish immigration and land sales to Jews.[35] The issuance of the 1939 White Paper by the British gove rnment aimed to address escalating tensions between Arabs and Jews in Palestine.[35] This policy document imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration and land purchases, with the intention to limit the establishment of a Jewish state.[35] Met with strong opposition from the Zionist movement, the White Paper was perceived as a betrayal of the Balfour Declaration and Zionist aspirations for a Jewish homeland.[35] In response to the White Paper, the Zionist community in Palestine organized a strike in 1939, rallying against the restrictions on Jewish immigration and land acquisition.[35] This anti-White Paper strike involved demonstrations, civil disobedience, and a shutdown of businesses.[35] Supported by various Zionist organizations, including the Jewish Agency and the Histadrut (General Federation of Jewish Labor), the anti-White Paper strike aimed to protest and challenge the limitations imposed by t he British gove rnment.[35] In the late 1930s and 1940s , several Zionist militant groups, including the Irgun, Hagana, and Lehi, carried out acts of violence against British military and civilian targets in their pursuit of an independent Jewish state.[35] While the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II, inot all Muslims suppor ted his actions, and there were instances where Muslims helped rescue Jews during the Holocaust.[35] In 1946, a bombing orchestrated by the Irgun at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem resulted in the deaths of 91 people, including British officials, civilians, and hotel staff.[35] Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, who later became political leaders in the state of Israel, were behind these terrorist attacks.[36] The Exodus 1947 incident unfolded when a ship carrying Jewish Holocaust survivors, who sought refuge in Palestine, was intercepted by the British navy, leading to clashes and the eventual deportation of the refugees back to Europe.[35] During World War II, Palestine served as a strategically significant location for British military operations against Axis forces in North Africa.[35] In 1947, the United Nations proposed a partition plan for Palestine, sugge sting separate Jewish and Arab states, but it was rejected by Arab nations while accepted by J ewish leaders.[35] In 1947, the UN adopted a partition plan for a two-state solution in the remaining territory of the mandate.
The plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership but rejected by the Arab leaders, and Britain refused to implement the plan. On the eve of final British withdrawal, the Jewish Agency for Israel, headed by David Ben-Gurion, declared the establishment of the State of Israel according to the proposed UN plan.The Arab Higher Committee did not declare a state of its own and instead, together with Transjordan, Egypt, and the other members of the Arab League of the time, commenced military action resulting in the 1948 Arab– Israeli War.During the war, Israel gained additional territories that were designated to be part of the Arab state unde r the UN plan.Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip, and Transjordan occupied and then annexed the West Bank.Egypt initially supported the creation of an All-Palestine Government but disbanded it in 1959.Transjordan never recognized it and instead decided to incorporate the West Bank with its own territory to form Jordan.
The annexation w as ratified in 1950 but was rejected by t he international community.Arab–Israeli wars In 1964, when the West Bank was controlled by Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization was established there with the goal to confront Israel. The Palestinian National Charter of the PLO defines the bounda ries of Palestine as the whole remaining territory of the mandate, including Israel.
The Six-Day War in 1967, when Israel fought against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, ended with Israel occupying the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, besides other territories.[37] Following the Six-Day War, the PLO moved to Jordan, but later relocated to Lebanon in 1971.[38] The October 1974 Arab League summit designated the PLO as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people" and reaffirmed "their right to establish an independent state of urgency."[39] In November 1974, the PLO was recognized as competent on all matters concerning the question of Palestine by the UN General Assembly granting them observer status as a "non-state entity" at the UN.[40][41] Through the Camp David Accords of 1979, Egypt signaled an end to any claim of its own over the Gaza Strip. In July 1988, Jordan ceded its claims to the West Bank—with the exception of guardianship over Haram al-Sharif—to the PLO.
After Israel captured and occupied the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza Strip from Egypt, it began to establish Israeli settlements there. Administration of the Arab popul ation of these territories was performed by the Israeli Civil Administration of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories and by local municipal counc ils present since before the Israeli takeover.In 1980, Israel decided to freeze elections for these counc ils and to establish instead Village Leagues, whose officials were unde r Israeli influence.
Later this model became ineffective for both Israel and the Palestinians, and the Village Leagues began to break up, w ith the last being the Hebron League, dissolved in February 1988.[42] The first Intifada broke out in 1987, characterized by widespread protests, strikes, and acts of civil disobedience by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank against Israeli occupation.[18] In November 1988, the PLO legislature, while in exile, declared the establishment of the "State of Palestine".[18] In the month following, it was quickly recognized by many states, including Egypt and Jordan.[18] In the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the State of Palestine is described as being established on the "Palestinian territory", without explicitly specifying further.[18][43] After the 1988 Declaration of Independence, the UN General Assembly officially acknow ledged the proclamation and decided to use the designation "Palestine" instead of "Palestine Liberation Organization" in the UN.[18][43] In spite of this decision, the PLO did not participate at the UN in its capacity of the State of Palestine's gove rnment.[44] Violent clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces intensified throughout 1989, resulting in a significant loss of life and escalating tensions in the occupied territories.[43] 1990 witnessed the imposition of strict measures by the Israeli gove rnment, including curfews and closures, in an attempt to suppress the Intifada and m aintain control over the occupied territories.[43] The 1990–1991 Gulf War brought increased attention to conflict, leading to heightened diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution.[45][46] Saddam Hussein was a suppor ter of Palestinian cause and won suppor t from Arafat during the war.[45] Following the invasion of Kuwait, Saddam surprised the international community by presenting a peace offer to Israel and withdrawing Iraqi forces from Kuwait, in exchange of withdrawal from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights.[45][46] Though the peace offer was rejected, Saddam then ordered firing of scud missiles into Israeli territory.[45] This movement was suppor ted by Palestinians.[45] The war also led expulsion of Palestinians from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, as their gove rnment suppor ted Iraq.[45][46]Uprising, declaration and peace treaty Intifada in Gaza Yasser Arafat Civil unrest in Jerusalem as a result of 1994 massacreIn 1993, the Oslo Accords were signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), leading to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and a potential path to peace.[47] Yasser Arafat was elected as president of the newly formed Palestinian Authority in 1994, marking a significant step towards self-gove rnance.[c] Israel acknowledged the PLO negotiating team as "representing the Palestinian people", in return for the PLO recognizing Israel's right to exist in peace, acceptance of UN Security Counc il resolutions 242 and 338, and its rejection of "violence and terrorism".[48] As a result, in 1994 the PLO established the Palestinian National Authority (PNA or PA) territorial administration, that exercises some gove rnmental functions[c] in parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.[57][58] As envisioned in the Oslo Accords, Israel allowed the PLO to establish interim administrative institutions in the Palestinian territories, which came in the form of the PNA.[59][60] It was given civilian control in Area B and civilian and security control in Area A, and remained without involvement in Area C.[60] The peace process gained oppos ition from both Palestinians and Israelis.
Islamist militant organizations such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad oppos ed the attack and responde d by conduc ting attacks on civilians across Israel. In 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli extremist shot 29 people to death in Hebron, know n as the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre.These events led an increase in Palestinian oppos ition to the peace process.Tragically, in 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir — an extremist, causing pol itical instability in the region.The first-ever Palestinian general elections took place in 1996, resulting in Arafat's re-election as president and the formation of a Palestinian Legislative Counc il.
Initiating the implementation of the Oslo Accords, Israel began redeploying its forces from select Palestinian cities in the West Bank in 1997.[61] Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority continued, albeit with slow progress and contentious debates on Jerusalem, settlements, and refugees in 1998.[61] In 1997, Israeli gove rnment led by Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian gove rnment signed the Hebron Protocol, which outlined the redeployment of Israeli forces from parts of Hebron in the West Bank, granting the gove rnment greater control over the city.[61] Israel and the Palestinian gove rnment signed the Wye River Memorandum in 1998, aiming to advance the implementation of the Oslo Accords.[61] The agreement included provisions for Israeli withdrawals and security coope ration.[61][62] The period of Oslo Years, brought a great prosperity to the gove rnment-controlled areas, despite some econom ic issues.
The Palestinian Authority built country's second airport in Gaza, after the Jerusalem International Airport. Inaugural ceremony of the airport was attended by Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela.Civil unrest in Hebron The Church of the Nativity under siege in 2002In 1999, Ehud Barak assumed the position of Israeli Prime Minister, renewing efforts to reach a final status agreement with the Palestinians.The Camp David Summit in 2000 aimed to resolve the remaining issues but concluded without a comprehensive agreement, serving as a milestone in the peace process.A peace summit between Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak was mediated by Bill Clinton in 2000.[63][64] It was supposed to be the final agreement ending conflict officially forever.
However the agreement failed to address the Palestinian refugee issues, status of Jerusalem and Israeli security concerns.[63][64] Both sides blamed each other of the summit failures.[63][64] This became of the main triggers for the uprising that would happen next.[63][64] In September 2000, then oppos ition leader from the Likud Party – Ariel Sharon made a proactive visit to the Temple Mount and delivered a controversial speech, which angered Palestinian Jerusalemite.[63][64] The tensions escalated into riots.[63][64] Bloody clashes took place around Jerusalem.
Escalating violence resulted closure of Jerusalem Airport, which haven't operated till date.[63] More and more riots between Jews and Arabs took pl ace in October 2000 in Israel.[63][64] In the same month, two Israeli soldiers were lynched and killed in Ramallah.[63] Between November and December clashes between Palestinians and Israelis increased further.[63] In 2001 Taba summit was held between Israel and Palestine.[63] But the summit failed to implement and Ariel Sharon became prime minister in the 2001 elections.[63] By 2001, attacks from Palestinian militant groups towards Israel increased.[63][64] Gaza Airport was destroyed in an airstrike by Israeli army in 2001, claiming itself in retaliation to previous attacks by Hamas.[63][64] In January 2002, the IDF Shayetet 13 naval commandos captured the Karine A, a freighter carrying weapons from Iran towards Israel.[63] UNSC Resolution 1397 was passed, which reaffirmed a Two-state solution and laid the groundw ork for a Road map for peace.[63] An another attack by Hamas left 30 people killed in Netanya.[63] A peace summit was organized by the Arab Leauge in Beirut, which was endorsed by Arafat and vi rtually ignored by I srael.[63] In 2002, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield after the Passover massacre.[64] Heavy fighting between IDF and Palestinian fighters took place in Jenin.[64][62][65] The Church of the Nativity was besieged by the IDF for one week unt il successful negotiations took pl ace, which resulted withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the church.[64] Between 2003 and 2004, people from Qawasameh tribe in Hebron were either killed or blew themselves in suicide bombing.[64][61] Ariel Sharon ordered construction of barriers across Palestinian controlled areas and Israeli settlements in the West Bank to prevent future attacks.[64] Saddam Hussein provided financial suppor t to Palestinian militants from Iraq during the intifada period, from 2000 until his overthrew in 2003.[64] A peace propos al was made in 2003,w hich was suppor ted by Arafat and rejected by S haron.[64] In 2004 H amas leader and its co-founde r Ahmed Yassin was assassinated by the Israeli army in Gaza.[64][61] Yasser Arafat was confined to his headqua rters in Ramallah.[64] On 11 November, Yasser Arafat died in Paris.[64]Second intifada and civil war Demonstration against road block, Kafr Qaddum, March 2012On first week of 2005, Mahmoud Abbas was elected as the president of the State of Palestine.[64] In 2005, Israel completely withdrew from the Gaza Strip by destroying its settlements over there.[64] By 2005, the situation began de-escalating.[64] In 2006, Hamas won in Palestinian legislative elections.[66] This led a political standoff with Fatah.[66] Armed clashes took place across both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.[66] The clashes turned into a civil war, which ended in a bloody clashes on the Gaza Strip.[66] As a result Hamas gained control allover the territory of Gaza.[66] Hundreds of people were killed in the civil war, including militants and civilians.[66] Since then Hamas gained more independence in its military practices.[66] Since 2007, Israel is leading a partial blockade on Gaza.[66] An another peace summit was organized by the Arab League in 2007, with same offer which was presented in 2002 summit.[66] However the peace process could not progressed.[66][67][68] The PNA gained full control of the Gaza Strip with the exception of its borders, airspace, and territorial waters.[c] The division between the West Bank and Gaza complicated efforts to achieve Palestinian unity and negotiate a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel.
Multiple rounds of reconciliation talks were held, but no lasting agreement was reached. The division also hindered the establishment of a unified Palestinian state and led to different gove rnance structures and pol icies in the two territories.[69] Throughout this period, there were sporadic outbreaks of violence and tensions between Palestinians and Israelis.Since 2001, Incidents of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israeli territory and Israeli military operations in respons e often resulted in casualties and further strained the situation.[70] Following the inter- Palestinian conflict in 2006, Hamas took over control of the Gaza Strip (it already had majority in the PLC), and Fatah took control of the West Bank.From 2007, the Gaza Strip was gove rned by Hamas, and the West Bank by t he Fatah party led Palestinian Authority.[71] International efforts to revive the peace process continued.
The United States, unde r the leadership of different administrations, made various attempts to broker negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.[72] However, significant obstacles such as settlement expansion, the status of Jerusalem, borders, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees, remained unresolved.[73][74][75][76] In recent years, diplomatic initiatives have emerged, including the normalization agreements between Israel and several Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords.[77] These agreements, while not directly addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, have reshaped regional dyna mics and raised questions about the future of Palestinian aspirations for statehood.[78][79] The status quo remains challenging for Palestinians, with ongoi ng issues of occupation, settlement expansion, restricted movement, and econom ic hardships.[80] Efforts to find a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continue, but the path towards a comprehensive peace agreement and the establishment of a viable, independent Palestinian state remains uncertain.Continued conflict Dead Sea bordering Palestine is the lowest point on earth Jordan River is the site of baptism of Jesus Mount Gerizim around Nablus is a holy place for Samaritans A modern day city scene across Jerusalem, with view of Temple Mount and Al Aqsa The areas claimed by the State of Palestine lie in the Southern Levant.
The Gaza Strip borders the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Egypt to the south, and Israel to the north and east. The West Bank is bordered by Jordan to the east, and Israel to the north, south, and west.Thus, the two enclaves constituting the area claimed by State of Palestine have no geographical border with one another, being separated by Israel.These areas would constitute the world's 163rd largest country by l and area.[8][81][82] The West Bank is located on the western side of the Jordan River and is characterized by a diverse landscape.It consists of fertile valleys, such as the Jezreel Valley and the Jordan River Valley, as well as mountainous areas, including the Samarian and Judean mountain ranges.[83] East Jerusalem, a part of the West Bank, is a significant compone nt of the Palestinian territories.It is located on a plateau in the central highlands and is surrounde d by valleys.
The Old City of Jerusalem, with its historical and religious sites, is centrally located within East Jerusalem. The Gaza Strip is a small coastal enclave located on t he eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea.Palestine has a number of environmental issues; issues facing the Gaza Strip include desertification; salination of fresh water; sewage treatment; water-borne diseases; soil degradation; and depletion and contamination of unde rground water resources.
In the West Bank, many of the same issues apply; although fresh water is much more plentiful, access is restricted by t he ongoi ng dispute.[84] The Samarian Hills and Judean Hills are mountain ranges in the West Bank, with Mount Gerizim and Mount Hebron as their highest peaks.[85] The Mount of Olives (Jabal Zaytun) is a significant hill east of Jerusalem, known for its religious sites.[86] Mount Carmel extends into the northern West Bank and isGeography Camels on Judaean Desertrenowned for its natural beauty.[87] Three terrestrial ecoregions are found i n the area: Eastern Mediterranean conifer–sclerophyl lous–broadleaf forests, Arabian Desert, and Mesopotamian shrub desert.[88] Palestine features significant lakes and rivers that play a vital role in its geography and ecosystems.[89] The Jordan River flows southward, forming part of Palestine's eastern border and passing through the Sea of Galilee before reaching the Dead Sea.[90] These waterways provide essential resources for agriculture, recreation, and suppor t various ecosystems.[89] Temperatures in Palestine vary widely.
The climate in the West Bank is mostly Mediterranean, slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline, west to the area. In the east, the West Bank includes much of the Judean Desert including the western shoreline of the Dead Sea, characterised by dry and hot climate.Gaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppe n: BSh) with mild winters and dry hot summers.Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months are July and August, with the average high being 33 °C (91 °F).The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at 7 °C (45 °F).Rain is scarce and generally falls between November and March, with annua l precipitation rates approximately at 4.57 inches (116 m m).[91] Palestine does not have officially recognized national parks or protected areas.However, there are areas within the West Bank that are considered to have ecological and cultural significance and are being managed with conservation efforts.
These areas are often referred to as nature reserves or protected zones. Located near Jericho in the West Bank, Wadi Qelt is a desert valley with unique flora and fauna.The reserve is know n for its rugge d landscapes, natural springs, and historical sites such as the St.George Monastery.[92] Efforts have been made to protect the biodiversity and natural beauty of the area.[93] The Judaean Desert is popul ar for "Judaean Camels".Qalqilya Zoo in Qalqilya Governorate, is the only zoo currently active in the country.Gaza Zoo was closed due to poor conditions.Israeli gove rnment have built various national parks in the Area C, which is also considered illegal unde r international law.Palestine is a semi-presidential country.
The country consists of the institutions that are associated with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which includes President of the State of Palestine[94][b] – appointed by the Palestinian Central Counc il,[97] Palestinian National Counc il – the legislature that established the State of Palestine[5] and Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization – performs the functions of a gove rnment in exile,[95][96][98][99] maintaining an extensive foreign-relations network. The Palestine Liberation O rganization (PLO) is combination of several political parties.These should be distinguished from the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Palestinian Legislative Counc il (PLC) and PNA Cabinet, all of which are instead associated with the Palestinian National Authority.
The State of Palestine's foundi ng document is the Palestinian Declaration ofClimate Biodiversity Government and politics President Mahmoud Abbas Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa Mausoleum of Yasser Arafat at the Palestinian Authority's headquarters in RamallahIndependence,[5] and it should be distinguished from the unrelated PLO Palestinian National Covenant and PNA Palestine Basic Law. The Palestinian gove rnment is divided into two geographic entities — the Palestinian Authority gove rned by Fatah and have control over the territory of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which is unde r control of the militant group Hamas.[100][101] Fatah is a secular party, which was founde d by Yasser Arafat and relatively enjoys good relations with the western powers.On other hand, Hamas is a militant group, based on Palestinian nationalist and Islamic ideology, inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood .[102][103] Hamas has tense relations with the United States, but receives suppor t from Iran.
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is another popul ar secular party, which was founde d by George Habash.
Mahmoud Abbas is the president of the country since 2005.[104] Mohammad Shtayyeh was the prime minister of Palestine, who resigned in 2024.[105] In 2024, Mohammad Mustafa was appointed as the new prime minister of the country, after resigning of Shtayyeh.[106] While Yahya Sinwar is leader of Hamas gove rnment in the Gaza Strip.[107] According to Freedom House, the PNA gove rns Palestine in an authoritarian manner, including by repressing activists and journalists critical of the gove rnment.[108] Jerusalem including Haram ash-Shar if, is claimed as capital by Palestine, which has been unde r occupation by Israel.[109] Currently the temporary administration center is in Ramallah, which is 10 km from Jerusalem.[110] Muqata hosts state ministries and representative office.[111] The former building Gaza was destroyed in 2009 war.[112] In 2000, a gove rnment building was built in Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis, to hous e office of Yasser Arafat and Palestinian parliament.[113] Since second intifada, condition of the town made this site unsuitable to operate as a capital, either temporarily or permanently.[114] Nevertheless, the Palestinian entity have maintained their presence in the city.
As few parts of the city is also unde r Palestinian control and m any some countries have their consulates in Jerusalem. The State of Palestine has a number of security forces, including a Civil Police Force, National Security Forces and Intelligence Services, with the function of maintaining security and protecting Palestinian citizens and the Palestinian State.All of these forces are part of Palestinian Security Services.
The PSF is primarily respons ible for maintaining internal security, law enforcement, and counterterrorism operations in areas unde r Palestinian Authority control.[115] The Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA) is the standing army of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).[116] It was established during the early years of the Palestinian national movement but has largely been inactive since the Oslo Accords.[117] The PLA's role was intended to be a conve ntional military force but has shifted to a more symbolic and political role.[118] There are various armed factions within Palestine, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip and other smaller groups.[119] These factions haveLaw and security Map of the Palestinian Governorates (official) Map of showing Palestinian controlled areas Map of Israeli settlements in the West Banktheir own armed wings (Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigade s and Al Quds Brigade s) and maintain paramilitary capabilities.[120] They primarily focus on resistance activities against Israeli occupation and have engaged in armed conflicts with Israel in the past.[121] The military capabilities of Palestine are significantly limited compared to the Israeli army (IDF).[122] The Oslo Accords and subsequent agreements have placed restrictions on the size and armament of Palestinian security forces.[123][124] The PA's security forces primarily focus on internal security rather than conve ntional military ope rations.[125] The State of Palestine is divided into sixteen administrative divisions.
The gove rnorates in the West Bank are groupe d into three areas per the Oslo II Accord. Area A forms 18% of the West Bank by area, and is administered by the Palestinian gove rnment.[126][127] Area B forms 22% of the West Bank, and is unde r Palestinian civil control, and joint Israeli- Palestinian security control.[126][127] Area C, except East Jerusalem, forms 60% of the West Bank, and is administered by the Israeli Civil Administration, however, the Palestinian gove rnment provides the education and medical services to the 150,000 Palestinians in the area,[126] an arrangement agreed upon in the Oslo II accord by Israeli and Palestinian leadership.
More than 99% of Area C is off limits to Palestinians, due to security concerns and is a point of ongo ing negotiation.[128][129] There are about 330,000 Israelis living in settlements in Area C.[130] Although Area C is under martial law, Israelis living there are entitled to full civic rights.[131] Palestinian enclaves currently unde r Palestinian administration in red (Areas A and B ; not including G aza Strip, which is unde r Hamas rule). East Jerusalem (comprising the small pre-1967 Jordanian eastern-sector Jerusalem municipality together with a significant area of the pre-1967 West Bank demarcated by Israel in 1967) is administered as part of the Jerusalem District of Israel but is claimed by Palestine as part of the Jerusalem Governorate.
It was effectively annexed by Israel in 1967, by application of Israeli law, jurisdiction and administration unde r a 1948 law amended for the purpose, this purported annexation being constitutionally reaffirmed (by implication) in Basic Law: Jerusalem 1980 ,[126] but this annexation is not recognised by any other country.[132] In 2010 of the 456,000 people in East Jerusalem, roughl y 60% were Palestinians and 40% were Israelis.[126][133] However, since the late 2000s , Israel's West Bank Security Barrier has effectively re-annexed tens of thousands of Palestinians bearing Israeli ID cards to the WestAdministrative divisions A map showing governorates of PalestineBank, leaving East Jerusalem within the barrier with a small Israeli majority (60%). Under Oslo Accords, Jerusalem was propos ed to be included in future negotiations and according to Israel, Oslo Accords prohibits the Palestinian Authority to operates in Jerusalem.
However, certain parts of Jerusalem, those neighbor hoods which are located outside the historic Old City but are part of East Jerusalem, were allotted to the Palestinian Authority.[134] NameArea (km2)[135]PopulationDensity (per km2)Muhafazah (district capital) Jenin 583 311,231 533.8 Jenin Tubas 402 64,719 161.0 Tubas Tulkarm 246 182,053 740.0 Tulkarm Nablus 605 380,961 629.7 Nablus Qalqiliya 166 110,800 667.5 Qalqilya Salfit 204 70,727 346.7 Salfit Ramallah & Al-Bireh855 348,110 407.1 Ramallah Jericho & Al Aghwar593 52,154 87.9 Jericho Jerusalem 345 419,108a1214.8[i]Jerusalem (see Status of Jerusalem) Bethlehem 659 216,114 927.9 Bethlehem Hebron 997 706,508 708.6 Hebron North Gaza61 362,772 5947.1 Jabalya Gaza 74 625,824 8457.1 Gaza City Deir Al- Balah58 264,455 4559.6Deir al- Balah Khan Yunis108 341,393 3161.0 Khan Yunis Rafah 64 225,538 3524.0 Rafah i.
Data from Jerusalem includes occupied East Jerusalem with its Israeli population The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) represents the State of Palestine and maintains embassies in countries that recognize it. The PLO also participates in international organizations as a member, associate, or observer.In some cases, due to conflicting sources, it is difficult to determine if the participation is on behalf of the State of Palestine, the PLO as a non-state entity, or the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).A majority of Arab and Muslim countries, including Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Yemen have suppor ted the country, due to religious and cultural relations.
Egypt and Jordan, apart from suppor ting, have also signed peace treaties with Israel.Foreign relations Belgian Consulate to Palestine in Jerusalem President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, inaugurating ICT center at Al-Quds University, Jerusalem in 2015Egypt and Qatar acts as a mediator between Hamas controlled Gaza and Israel.[136][137] Countries like India and Republic of Ireland have strongly showed suppor t of an independent Palestine, coexisting w ith Israel.[138][139] In 1988, the State of Palestine's declaration of independence was acknow ledged by the General Assembly with Resolution 43/177.[140] In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 67/19, granting Palestine "non-member observer state" status, effectively recognizing it as a sovereign state.[141][142][143] Sweden took a significant step in 2013 by upgrading the status of the Palestinian representative office to a full embassy.
They became the first EU member state outside the former communist bloc to officially recognize the state of Palestine.[144][145][146] The UK House of Commons voted in favor of recognizing Palestine as a state in 2014, as a contribution towards achieving a negotiated two-state solution.[147] However, the UK gove rnment maintained its policy of reserving the right to recognize Palestine bilaterally at a more oppor tune time for peace efforts.[148] Similarly, in 2014, the French parliament passed a resolution urging their gove rnment to recognize Palestine as a state, with the intention of facilitating a definitive resolution to the conflict.[149] A United Nations Security Counc il resolution propos ed in 2014, calling for the end of Israeli occupation and statehood by 2017, di d not pass due to oppos ition and abstentions.[150][151][152][153] In January 2015, the International Criminal Court affirmed Palestine's "State" status after its UN observer recognition,[154] a move condemned by Israeli leaders as a form of “diplomatic terrorism.” [155]The Vatican shifted recognition to the State of Palestine in May 2015, following the 2012 UN vote.[156] This change aligned with the Holy See's evolving position.[157] In December 2015, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding Palestinian sovereignty over natural resources in the occupied territories.
It called on Israel to cease exploitation and damage while granting Palestinians the right to seek restitution.[158] Currently, 139 UN member states (72%) recognize the State of Palestine. Though some do not recognize it, they acknow ledge the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.The PLO's executive committee acts as the gove rnment, empowered by the PNC.[159] Palestine is a member of the United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Coope ration, the Arab League, the G77, the International Olympic Committee and the Union for the Mediterranean.
Legal status State of Palestine Countries that have recognised the State of Palestine Countries that have not recognised the State of PalestineThere are a wide variety of views regarding the status of the State of Palestine, both among the states of the international community and among legal scholars.[160] The existence of a state of Palestine, although controversial,[161] is a reality in the opinions of the states that have established bilateral diplomatic relations.[162] In August 2015, Palestine's representatives at the UN presented a draft resolution that would allow the non- member observer states Palestine and the Holy See to raise their flags at the United Nations headqua rters. Initially, the Palestinians presented their initiative as a joint effort with the Holy See, which the Holy See denied.[163] In a letter to the Secretary General and the President of the General Assembly, Israel's Ambassador at the UN Ron Prosor called the step "another cynical misuse of the UN ...
in order to score political points".[164] After the vote, which was passed by 119 votes to 8 with 45 countries abstaining,[165][166][167] the US Ambassador Samantha Power said that "raising the Palestinian flag will not bring Israelis and Palestinians any closer together".[168] US Department of State spoke sman Mark Toner called it a "counterproduc tive" attempt to pur sue statehood c laims outside of a negotiated settlement.[169] At the ceremony itself, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the occasion was a "day of pride for the Palestinian people around the world, a day of hope ",[170] and declared "Now is the time to restore confidence by both Israelis and Palestinians for a peaceful settlement and, at last, the realization of two states for two peoples."[165] The State of Palestine has been recognized by 145 of the 193 UN members and since 2012 has had a status of a non-member observer state in the United Nations.[171][172][173] On 29 November 2012, in a 138–9 vote (with 41 abstentions and 5 absences),[174] the United Nations General Assembly passed resolution 67/19, upgrading Palestine from an "observer entity" to a "non-member observer state" within the United Nations System, which was described as recognition of the PLO's sovereignty.[172][173][175][95][143] Palestine's new status is equivalent to that of the Holy See.[176] The UN has permitted Palestine to title its representative office to the UN as "The Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations",[177] and Palestine has instructed its diplomats to officially represent "The State of Palestine"—no longe r the Palestinian National Authority.[143] On 17 December 2012, UN Chief of Protocol Yeocheol Yoon declared that "the designation of 'State of Palestine' shall be used by the Secretariat in all official United Nations documents",[178] thus recognising the title 'State of Palestine' as the state's official name for all UN purposes; on 21 December 2012, a UN memorandum discussed appropriate terminology to be used following GA 67/19.
It was noted therein that there was no legal impediment to using the designationRaising the flag at the UN International recognition Construction of Rawabi Industrial area and some of the neighborhoods Ammar Tower in Al-BirehPalestine to refer to the geographical area of the Palestinian territory. At the same time, it was explained that there was also no bar to the continued use of the term "Occupied Palestinian Territory including East Jerusalem" or such other terminology as might customarily be used by the Assembly.[179] As of 21 June 2024, 145 (75.1% ) of the 193 member states of the United Nations have recognised the State of Palestine.[95][180] Many of the countries that do not recognise the State of Palestine nevertheless recognise the PLO as the "representative of the Palestinian people".
The PLO's Executive Committee is empowered by the Palestinian National Counc il to perform the functions of gove rnment of the State of Palestine.[96] On 2 April 2024, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, requested that the Security Counc il consider a renewed application for membership, suppor ted by the 22-nation Arab Group at the United Nations, the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Coope ration, and the 120-member Nonaligned Movement. As of April, seven of the counc il's 15 members recognize the state of Palestine but the US has indicated that it oppos es the request and in addition, US law stipulates that US funding for the UN would be cut off in the event of full recognition without an Israeli-Palestinian agreement.[181] On 18 April, the US vetoed a widely suppor ted UN resolution that would have admitted Palestine as a full UN member.[182][183][184] Palestine is classified as a middle income and developing country by the IMF.
In 2023 , GDP of the country was $40 billion and per- capita around $4,500. Due to its disputed status, the econom ic condition have been affected.[185][186][187] The CO2 Emission (metric tons per capita) was 0.6 in 2010.According to a survey of 2011, Palestine's pove rty rate was 25.8% .According to a new World Bank report, Palestinian econom ic growth is expected to soften in 2023.
Econom y of Palestine relies heavily on international aids, remittances by ove rseas Palestinians and local industries.[188] Since 1970s , Palestinians were employed in Israel.[189] During this period, the Palestinian econom y was significantly greater than the majority of Arab states.[189] The period between 1993 and 2000, know n as "Oslo Years", brought a great prosperity to the country.[189] In 1998 , the Palestinian Authority built Gaza International Airport.[190] Signed in 1994, the Paris Protocols however have prohibited the country from having its own currency.[189] The 2000–2005 uprisings severely affected the econom y and destroyed the national infrastructure.[189] After victory of Hamas, sanctions were imposed , which was lifted up later.[189] Since 2007, Israel have blockaded the Gaza Strip.
In 2008, Salam Fayyad became the prime minister and instituted reforms, which improved the econom y.[189] Since 2010, Palestine experienced a moderate econom ic boom .[191] The Gaza Strip was also recovering slightly until it was crashed in the 2023 w ar. Palestinian econom y relies heavily on dona tions and international aid from various sources, including UNRWA, Qatar, Turkey, the European Union, and non-gove rnmental organizations.[192][193] Contribution to the econom y also comes from remittances sent by the Palestinian diaspora.[194][195] Gazans experience additional difficulties as they are subjected to a siege, with Israel controlling the movement of people andEconomy goods in and out of Gaza.Nonetheless, there are limited business oppor tunities available in Gaza.
Contrastingly, the West Bank provides Palestinians with more diverse oppor tunities.[196] Some individuals own businesses in tourism-driven areas such as Bethlehem and Jerusalem, as tourism serves as a significant source of income.[197][198] Others engage in various types of enterprises in cities like Ramallah and Hebron, ranging from trading to construction and IT services.[199][200] Furthermore, approximately 100,000 Palestinians find employment in Israeli companies as low-cost labor, earning significantly less than the average Israeli worker.
After Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, Palestinian agriculture suffered significant setbacks.[201] The sector's contribution to the GDP declined, and the agricultural labor force decreased.[201] The cultivated areas in the West Bank continuous ly declined since 1967.[201] Palestinian farmers face obstacles in marketing and distributing their produc ts, and Israeli restrictions on water usage have severely affected Palestinian agriculture.[201] Over 85% of Palestinian water from the West Bank aquifers is used by Israel, and Palestinians are denied access to water resources from the Jordan and Yarmouk R ivers.[201] In Gaza, the coastal aquifer is suffering from saltwater intrusion.[201] Israeli restrictions have limited irrigation of Palestinian land, with only 6% of West Bank land cultivated by Palestinians being irrigated, while Israeli settlers irrigate around 70% of their land.[201] The Gulf War in 1991 had severe repercussions on Palestinian agriculture, as the majority of exports were previously sent to Arab Gulf countries.[201] Palestinian exports to the Gulf States declined by 14% as a result of the war, causing a significant econom ic impact.[201] Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories are characterized by severe water shortage and are highly influenced by the Israeli occupation.
The water resources of Palestine are partially controlled by Israel due in part from historical and geographical complexities with Israel granting partial autonom y in 2017.[202] The division of groundw ater is subject to provisions in the Oslo II Accord, agreed upon by both Israeli and Palestinian leadership. Israel provides the Palestinian territories water from its own water supply and de salinated water supplies, in 2012 s upplying 52 MCM.[203][204] Generally, the water quality is considerably worse in the Gaza Strip when compared to the West Bank.About a third to half of the delivered water in the Palestinian territories is lost in the distribution network.
The lasting bl ockade of the Gaza Strip and the Gaza War have caused severe damage to the infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.[205][206] Concerning wastewater, the existing treatment plants do not have the capacity to treat all of the produc ed wastewater, causing severe water pollution.[207] The development of the sector highly depends on e xternal financing.[208] Manufacturing and exports in Palestine includes sectors such as textiles, food processing, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, furniture, plastic produc ts, stone, and electronics.[209] Some notable produc ts are garments, olive oil, dairy produc ts, furniture, ceramics, and construction materials.[210] Before the second intifada, Palestine had a strong indus trial base in Jerusalem and Gaza.
Barriers erected in the West Bank have made movement of goods difficult; the blockade of the Gaza Strip has severely affected the territory'sAgriculture Water supply and sanitation Manufacturing A solar plant in Jerichoeconom ic conditions. As of 2023, according to the Ministry of Econom y, the manufacturing sector expected to grow by 2.5% and create 79,000 jobs over the following six years.[211] Palestine mainly exports articles of stone (limestone, marble – 13.3% ), furniture (11.7% ), plastics (10.2% ) and iron and steel (9.1% ).Most of these produc ts are exported to Jordan, the United States, Israel and Egypt.Hebron is industrially most advanced city in the region and serves as an export hub for Palestinian produc ts.More than 40% of the national econom y produc ed there.[212] The most advanced printing press in the Middle East is in Hebron.[212] Many quarries are in the surroundi ng region.[213] Silicon reserves are found in the Gaza territory.
Jerusalem stone, extracted in the West Bank, has been used for constructing many structures in Jerusalem. Hebron is widely know n for its glass produc tion.Nablus is noted for its Nablus soap.Some of the companies operating in the Palestinian territories include Siniora Foods , Sinokrot Indus tries, Schneider Electric, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.[214] Israeli–Palestinian econom ic peace efforts have resulted in several initiatives, such as the Valley of Peace initiative and Breaking the Impasse, which promote industrial projects between Israel, Palestine and other Arab countries, with the goal of promoting peace and ending conflict.[215] These include joint industrial parks opened in Palestine.The Palestinian Authority has built industrial cities in Gaza, Bethlehem, Jericho, Jenin and H ebron.S ome are in joint coope ration w ith European countries.[216] Palestine does not produc e its own oil or gas.
But as per UN reports, "sizeable reserves of oil and gas" lie in the Palestinian territories. Due to its state of conflict, most of the energy and fuel in Palestine are imported from Israel and other all neighbor ing countries such as Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.In 2012, electricity available in West Bank and Gaza was 5,370 GW-hour (3,700 in the West Bank and 1,670 in Gaza), while the annua l per capita consumption of electricity (after deducting transmission loss) was 950 kWh.The Gaza Power Plant is the only power plant in the Gaza Strip.It is owned by Gaza Power Generating Company (GPGC), a subsidiary of the Palestine Electric Company (PEC).Jerusalem District Electricity Company, a subsidiary of PEC, provides electricity to Palestinan residents of Jerusalem.Government officials have increasingly focused on solar energy to reduce dependency on Israel for energy.
Palestine Investment Fund have launched "Noor Palestine", a project which aims to provide power in Palestine.[217] Qudra Energy, a joint venture between Bank of Palestine and NAPCO have established solar power plants across Jammala, Nablus, Birzeit and Ramallah.[218] In 2019, unde r Noor Palestine campaign, first solar power plant and solar park was inaugurated in Jenin.
Two more solar parks have been planned for Jericho and Tubas.[219] A new solar power plant is unde r construction at Abu Dis campus of Al-Quds University, for serving Palestinian Jerusalemites.[220] Palestine holds massive potential reserves of oil and gas.[221] Over 3 billion barrels (480,000,000 m3) of oil are estimated to exist off the coast and be neath occupied Palestinian lands.[221][222] The Levant Basin hol ds around 1.7 billion barrels (270,000,000 m3) of oil, with another 1.5 billion barrels (240,000,000 m3) barrelsEnergy Oil and gas A multilingual signboard in Hebron Governoratebeneath the occupied West Bank area.[222] Around 2 billion barrels (320,000,000 m3) of oil reserves are believed to exist in shore of the Gaza Strip.[222][223] According to a report by the UNCTAD, around 1,250 billion barrels (1.99 ×1011 m3) of oil reserves are in the occupied Palestinian territory of the West Bank, probably the Meged oil field.
As per the Palestinian Authority, 80% of this oil field falls unde r the lands owned by P alestinians.
Masadder, a subsidiary of the Palestine Investment Fund is developing the oilfield in the West Bank.[223] Block-1 field, which spans an area of 432 square kilometres (167 sq mi) from northwest Ramallah to Qalqilya in Palestine, has significant potential for recoverable hydrocarbon resources.[223][224] It is estimated to have a P90 (a level of certainty) of 0.03 billion barrels (4,800,000 m3) of recoverable oil and 6,000,000,000 cubic feet (170,000,000 m3).[223] The estimated cost for the development of the field is $390 million, and it will be carried out unde r a produc tion sharing agreement with the Government of Palestine.[223][225][226] Currently, an initial pre-exploration work program is unde rway to prepare for designing an exploration plan for approval, which will precede the full-fledged development of the field.[223] Natural gas in Palestine is mostly found in Gaza Strip.[225] Gaza Marine is a natural gas field, located around 32 kilometres (20 mi) from the coast of the territory in the Mediterranean shore.[227] It holds gas reserves ranging between 28 billion cubic metres (990 billion cubic feet) to 32 billion cubic metres (1.1 trillion cubic feet).[228] These estimates far exceed the needs of the Palestinian territories in energy.[229] The gas field was discovered by the British Gas Group in 1999.[230] Upon the discovery of the gas field, it was lauded by Yasser Arafat as a "Gift from God".
A regional coope ration between the Palestinian Authority, Israel and Egypt were signed for developing the field and Hamas also gave approval to the Palestinian Authority.[231][232] However, since the ongoi ng war in Gaza, this project have been delayed.[232] Two airports of Palestine — Jerusalem International Airport and Gaza International Airport were destroyed by Israel in the early years of the second intifada.[233] Since then no any airport has been operational in the country. Palestinians used to travel through airports in Israel — Ben Gurion Airport and Ramon Airport and Queen Alia International Airport of Amman, capital of Jordan.Many proposals have been made by both the gove rnment and private entities to build airports in the country.
In 2021, the most recent proposal was made by both the Palestinian gove rnment and Israeli gove rnment to redevelop Qalandia Airport as a binational airport for both Israelis and Palestinians.[234]Transportation Al Deira Hotel in Gaza, before the 2023 Israel Hamas war Jerusalem is holy for world's three major religions — Christianity, Islam and Judaism, as well as for MandaeismGaza Strip is the only coastal region of Palestine, where Port of Gaza is located. It is unde r naval siege by Israel, since the territory's blockade.During Oslo years, the Palestinian gove rnment collaborated with the Netherlands and France to build an international seaport but the project was abandone d.In 2021, then prime minister of Israel Naftali Bennett launched a development project for Gaza, which would include a seaport.[235] Tourism in the country refers to tourism in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
In 2010, 4.6 million people visited the Palestinian territories, compared to 2.6 million in 2009. Of that number, 2.2 million were foreign tourists while 2.7 million were domestic.[236] Most tourists come for only a few hours or as part of a day trip itinerary.In the last quarter of 2012 over 150,000 guests stayed in West Bank hotels; 40% were European and 9% were from the United States and Canada.[237] Lonely Planet travel guide writes that "the West Bank is not the easiest place in which to travel but the effort is richly rewarded."[238] Sacred sites such as the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque draw countless pilgrims and vi sitors each year.
