# Chat Application with Enhanced Capabilities

## Overview

This project implements a chat application using Python's tkinter for the GUI and integrates with Ollama for natural language processing capabilities. It allows users to interact via text input and receive responses enriched by context from a vault of documents.

## Features

- **User Interface**: Built with tkinter, providing a simple GUI for user interaction.
- **Integration with Ollama**: Utilizes Ollama for generating responses based on input and context from a document vault.
- **Document Vault**: Supports uploading and processing of PDF, text, and JSON files to build a vault of contextually relevant documents.
- **Conversation Logging**: Logs user interactions and system responses for future reference.
- **Query Rewriting**: Enhances user queries by rewriting them based on conversation history and relevant context.
